You wake up in your small little shack in Ivywood. It may be small and infested with roaches, but it's what you call home.
As you walk outside to take in the good ole morning scenery of ivywood, you notice that you have received mail!
You take the letter and read it out loud to yourself:
CALLING ALL CITIZENS! This is your very humble and handsome king here!
Recently we have been presented with a problem that could very well threaten the lives of everyone on Gnomesnore! If you wish to help save the lives of billions of people, come see me at the castle ASAP!
Signed, King Ragnail.
Oh man this isn’t good! You like living here! Having the entire world die would surely throw a wrench in your plans of doing absolutely nothing all day.
With absolutely nothing better to do, you throw on your pair of trusty leather armor and grab your sharpened wooden sword and set off for the adventure of your life

You walk into the local inn and bar. It’s surprisingly bustling for it being this early in the morning. If you plan on saving the world you might as well get wasted and have fun while doing so. What would you like to do?
